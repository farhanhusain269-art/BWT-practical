    <h2>Types of Network Topology.</h2>
    <h3><i>Network topology refers to the arrangement of different elements like nodes, links, or devices in a computer network.
         <u>Common types of network topology include bus, star, ring, mesh, and tree topologies, each with its advantages and 
         disadvantages.</u> In this article, we will discuss different types of network topology in detail.</i></h3>
        <h2><br><b>Point to Point Topology</b></h2>.
        <h3>Point-to-point topology is a type of topology that works on the functionality of the sender and receiver. 
            It is the simplest communication between two nodes, in which one is the sender and the other one is the receiver.
             Point-to-Point provides <del>lowe</del> <ins>high</ins> bandwidth.</h3>
             <p><b>Mesh Topology</b></p>
             <h3>Suppose, N number of devices are connected with each other in a mesh topology, then the total number of dedicated
                 links required to connect them is <sup>N</sup> C <sub>2</sub> i.e.<mark> N(N-1)/2.</mark></h3>
                 <p>Advantages of Mesh Topology</p>
                 <p>Communication is very fast between the nodes.Mesh Topology is robust.The fault is diagnosed easily. 
                    Data is reliable because data is transferred among the devices through dedicated channels or links.
                    Provides security and privacy.</p>
