    <h3><pr>Before the invention of computers, people relied on simple tools like sticks, stones, and bones to
        keep track of numbers and perform basic calculations.  As technology progressed and human understanding 
        grew, more advanced devices were developed, such as the abacus and Napier's Bones. 
        While these early tools served as basic computational devices, they were limited in their ability to
         handle complex calculations.

        <pr><h3><ln> abacus, created by the Chinese, is often regarded as the first computing device. 
        It consisted of beads strung on rods and was used to perform simple arithmetic operations like addition 
        and subtraction. Over time, different versions of the abacus spread across Asia, becoming an essential 
        tool for calculations.</ln></h3></pr>
